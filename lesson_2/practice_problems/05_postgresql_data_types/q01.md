## Assignment 5 Practice Problems: PostgreSQL Data Types

### Question 1

Describe the difference between the `varchar` and `text` data types.

### Solution

`varchar` and `text` are both data types that store characters. The `varchar`
type stores strings of varying lengths, up to a given maximum length. The `text`
type stores strings of any length. `text` is a non-standard PostgreSQL data
type. `varchar` is in the SQL standard.
