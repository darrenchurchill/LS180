## Assignment 11 Practice Problems: Using Keys

### Question 8

What error do you receive if you attempt to add another primary key column to
the `films` table?

### Solution

The `ALTER TABLE` statement below, attempting add a second primary key column:

```sql
ALTER TABLE films
ADD id_2 serial PRIMARY KEY
;
```

returns the error:

```text
ERROR:  multiple primary keys for table "films" are not allowed
```
