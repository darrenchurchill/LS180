# LS180 Lesson 2

## Assignment 10 Practice Problems: More Constraints

### Question 8

What error is shown if the title length constraint from Question 7 is violated?
Write a SQL `INSERT` statement that demonstrates this.

### Solution

```sql
INSERT INTO
    films (title, "year", genre, director, duration)
VALUES
    ('', 1800, 'test', 'test', 10)
;
```

When the length constraint is violated in an `INSERT` statement, the following
error is shown:

```text
ERROR:  new row for relation "films" violates check constraint "films_title_check"
DETAIL:  Failing row contains (, 1800, test, test, 10).
```
