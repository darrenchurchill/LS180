## Assignment 11 Practice Problems: Using Keys

### Question 7

What error do you receive if you attempt to update a row to have a value for
`id` that is used by another row?

### Solution

The `UPDATE` statement below, attempting to re-use `id` `1`:

```sql
UPDATE films
SET
    id = 1
WHERE
    id = 3
;
```

returns the error:

```text
ERROR:  duplicate key value violates unique constraint "films_pkey"
DETAIL:  Key (id)=(1) already exists.
```
