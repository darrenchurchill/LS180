## Assignment 4 Practice Problems: Database Diagrams: Cardinality and Modality

### Question 2

What is *modality*?

### Solution

Two entities' relationship's modality indicates whether the relationship is
required. We talk about modality in both directions of a relationship. For example,
an entity Books has a many-to-many relationship with the entity Categories. You
might decide a book must have a category but a category doesn't have to have a
book. In this case, the Books side's modality is 0 and the Categories side's
modality is 1.
