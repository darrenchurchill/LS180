## Assignment 11 Practice Problems: Using Keys

### Question 5

What will the name of the sequence created by the following SQL statement be?

```sql
CREATE TABLE regions (id serial PRIMARY KEY, name text, area integer);
```

### Solution

The default name of `serial` sequences is `<table_name>_<column_name>_seq`. The
`regions` table `id` sequence will have the name `regions_id_seq`.
