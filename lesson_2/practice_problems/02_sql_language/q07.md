## Assignment 2 Practice Problems: The SQL Language

### Question 7

The surface area of a sphere is calculated using the formula
`A = 4 * PI * r ** 2`, where `A` is the surface area, and `r` is the radius of
the sphere.

Use SQL to compute the surface area of a sphere with a radius of 26.3 cm,
truncated to return an integer.

### Solution

```sql
SELECT trunc(4 * pi() * 26.3 ^ 2); -- => 8692
```
