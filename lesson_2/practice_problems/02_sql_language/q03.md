## Assignment 2 Practice Problems: The SQL Language

### Question 3

Write the following values as quoted string values that could be used in an SQL
query.

```txt
canoe
a long road
weren't
"No way!"
```

### Solution

```sql
'canoe'
'a long road'
'weren''t'
'"No way!"'
```

SQL string literal values are single-quoted. In addition, you escape a single
quote inside a string literal value by prepending another single quote.
