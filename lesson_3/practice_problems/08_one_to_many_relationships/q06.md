# LS180 Lesson 3

## Assignment 8 Practice Problems: One-to-Many Relationships

### Question 6

Why does "when" need to be quoted in many of the queries in this lesson?

### Solution

`WHEN` is an SQL key word. In this database, `when` is also an identifier,
referencing the column in the `contacts` table. When an identifier has the same
case-insensitive name as a key word, SQL interprets it as the key word, unless
you use double quotes to explicitly indicate your intention to reference the
identifier.
