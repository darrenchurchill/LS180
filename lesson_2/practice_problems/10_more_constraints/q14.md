# LS180 Lesson 2

## Assignment 10 Practice Problems: More Constraints

### Question 14

How is the constraint added in Question 13 displayed by `\d films`?

### Solution

The director constraints are shown below the table description under the heading
"Check Constraints", along with the previously added year constraint:

```text
Check constraints:
    "films_director_length_check" CHECK (length(director::text) >= 3)
    "films_director_one_space_check" CHECK (regexp_like(director::text, '^\S.* .*\S$'::text))
    "films_year_check" CHECK (year >= 1900 AND year <= 2100)
```
