# LS180 Lesson 2

## Assignment 10 Practice Problems: More Constraints

### Question 16

List 3 ways to use the schema to restrict what values can be stored in a column.

### Solution

1. You can add a `NOT NULL` constraint to always require a value for the column.
2. You can add a `CHECK` constraint to require a column value pass the test in
   the given expression.
3. You can add a `UNIQUE` constraint to require a column's value to be unique in
   the table.
