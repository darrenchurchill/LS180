## Assignment 2 Practice Problems: The SQL Language

### Question 1

What kind of programming language is SQL?

### Solution

SQL is a special purpose declarative programming language. It's special purpose
in that you only use SQL to interact with a relational database. It's
declarative in that you specify *what* you want to do, rather than *how* you
want the RDBMS to accomplish the task.
