# LS180 Lesson 3

## Assignment 8 Practice Problems: One-to-Many Relationships

### Question 6

Why does "when" need to be quoted in many of the queries in this lesson?

### Solution

`WHEN` is an SQL "reserved key word". In this database, `when` is also an
identifier, referencing the column in the `contacts` table. When an identifier
has the same case-insensitive name as a reserved key word, SQL interprets it as
the key word, unless you use double quotes to explicitly indicate your intention
to reference the identifier.

See the [keywords appendix](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-keywords-appendix.html)
and this
[section](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-syntax-lexical.html#SQL-SYNTAX-IDENTIFIERS)
in the Lexical Structure PostgreSQL documentation.
