# Launch School LS180 Coursework

## Database Foundations

These are my assignment and practice problem solutions for LS180.

### Requirements

- `postgresql`

I installed `postgresql@16` with Homebrew.

```shell
brew install postgresql@16
```

### Setup

Clone repository and create any necessary databases with `createdb`. Some of
those `createdb`'s might be shell scripts inside the exercise directories.

### Sections

Many `sql` files include schema-modifying statements. Generally, numbered files
in each section should be executed in order by number.
