## Assignment 5 Practice Problems: PostgreSQL Data Types

### Question 5

Can a time with a time zone be stored in a column of type `timestamp`?

### Solution

No, the `timestamp` type can't store a time zone, but the
`timestamp with time zone` type can. `timestamptz` is a PostgreSQL-specific
abbreviation for `timestamp with time zone`.
