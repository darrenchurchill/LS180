# LS180 Lesson 2

## Assignment 7 Practice Problems: Loading Database Dumps

### Question 1

Load `films1.sql` into your database.

1. What does the file do?
2. What is the output of the command? What does each line in its output mean?
3. Open up the file and look at its contents. What does the first line do?

### Solution

1. `films1.sql` creates a `films` table, and inserts 3 rows of data into it.
2. The output of `psql ls180 < films1.sql` is:

    ```console
    NOTICE:  table "films" does not exist, skipping
    DROP TABLE
    CREATE TABLE
    INSERT 0 1
    INSERT 0 1
    INSERT 0 1
    ```

    Line 1 is a notice. It indicates the `DROP TABLE` statement is skipped
    because the `films` table doesn't exist yet.

    Line 2 denotes the end of the `DROP TABLE` output.

    Line 3 indicates the `CREATE TABLE` statement executed successfully.

    Lines 4-6 are each of the 3 `INSERT` statements' outputs. The first number
    is always 0 for historical reasons, and the second number is count of rows
    inserted.

3. The first line in `films1.sql` drops the `films` table only if it exists.
   This avoids an error if the table doesn't exist.
